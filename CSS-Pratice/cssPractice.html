		<h1>CIA Realizes It's Been Using Black Highlighters All These Years</h1>
		<h2>Director Demands Investigation</h2>
		<p>Adapted from The Onion<p></p>
		<img src="image/PorterGoss.webp" alt="[ Main image: PorterGoss.webp ]" >
		<p>LANGLEY, VA&ndash;&ndash;A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters. </p>

		<p>According to the report, sections of the documents&ndash;&ndash; "almost invariably the most crucial passages"&ndash;&ndash;are marred by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947.</p>

		<p>CIA Director <b>Porter Goss</b> lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several historic events, such as: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>the Cold War</li>
			<li>the civil-rights movement</li>
			<li>the growth of the international drug trade</li>
		</ul>
